####Music:
You can change the music that is playing during the game by adding it to the folder `sounds/right_music/`. 
For the game to run successfully, there must be at least something. **Don't change the music in the folder `sounds/`
like `amaizing.mp3` or `challenges.mp3`**, or, if you do want to do that, **don't change their names**.
####Appearance:
You can also change the environment, the aliens or ship appearance, however, the game may not look as attractive as it 
was before. So, if you change, **don't change the names!**
###That's all. Enjoy!
